# LESbrary.jl
Modeling framework to build a large library of large eddy simulations (LES) of ocean surface boundary layer turbulence — the _LESbrary_ — with [Oceananigans.jl](https://github.com/climate-machine/Oceananigans.jl).
The LESbrary will archive turbulence data for both idealized and realistic oceanic scenarios.

# Observational data
The Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE) is currently being used for pilot simulations although we're planning to also use ECCO v4 and ERA5 data.

SOSE data and also lots of plots being produced is on engaging at `/home/alir/cnhlab004/bsose_i122`.
